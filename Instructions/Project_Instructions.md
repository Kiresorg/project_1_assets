# Code Challenge 1 - Build a web page and push it to a Git repository

## Overall Project Description
You will be making a small web site that represents a fictional "Developer Relations" division of Liberty Mutual's IT operations.

The site will have two pages - a "home page" for the Developer Relations Division, and a "survey" page that presents a survey form to capture data from LM developers

You can use any folder/file structure you like. A typical structure might be this:

<pre>
ðŸ“¦project
 â”£ ðŸ“‚css
 â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œstyles.css
 â”£ ðŸ“‚img
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œada-lovelace.png
 â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œfavicon.png
 â”£ ðŸ“œindex.html
 â”£ ðŸ“œREADME.md
 â”— ðŸ“œsurvey.html
</pre>

## Minimum expectation for your work
- You have two pages - a home page and a survey page
- Navigation between the two pages works
- All links on the pages work - the nav bar link to LM home page, the Wikipedia link for Ada Lovelace, the email link, etc.
- The form on your survey page works, in that the "submit" action creates a query string that includes the values for all form fields

## Bonus points
- The pages are responsive, rendering well on smaller viewports
- The color palette uses official LM colors
- The data validation on the "Age" input warns users if they input data that isn't between 18-100
- Visual appearance similar to the site I created - content centered, etc.

## Content for the form dropdowns

### "Which option best describes your current role as it relates to IT?"
- Select how your current role relates to IT [disabled]
- I don't work in IT but I want to
- I work in IT
- I am a manager of IT personnel
- Other

### "What current technology at Liberty Mutual do you most feel should be phased out?"
- Select an option [disabled]
- ASP.NET WebForms
- Java
- COBOL
- SSIS

## Github repository
It is expected that you'll use VS code for this work, and that you will set up a local Git repo for your work.
You will also need to create a Github repo for this work, and push your code to that repo. It will need to be a public repo.

## Getting your work to me
I want to see the state of your work after three hours. Please push your code to the Github repo you create when you hit that time limit.
> NOTE: Please use the comment "Progress at the three hour mark" when you do this Push
If you're not done yet by the three hour mark, push anyway - and continue. You can even make more commits to the Github repo after that.

## Getting stuck
If you get stuck or frustrated, follow this advice:
- Walk away for a few minutes if you need to
- Google is your friend. Look up the issue you're having; it's certain someone else has encountered it and has some advice
- Review your Pluralsite materials. The transcripts can help you quickly locate the area with the data you need
- If you've done all that, and are still stuck, CONTACT ME. I am here to help.
